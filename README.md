WARNING THIS PROGRAM IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT,

but it is done enough for me not to be completely embarrased to share it

it's simply a text based minesweeper game

it is playable but the displaying of the number of adjacent mines is broken

and there is no flagging system yet. Any help/suggestions/improvements are 

welcomed and appreciated!! Send me pull requests!!!!!!!
